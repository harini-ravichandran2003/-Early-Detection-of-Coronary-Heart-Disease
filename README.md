# 🩺 Early Detection of Coronary Heart Disease Using Machine Learning

This project focuses on building a machine learning system to assist in the early prediction of coronary heart disease using patient health data.

## 🚀 Techniques Used

- **Data Preprocessing**  
  - Feature normalization using `StandardScaler`  
  - Train-test splitting with `sklearn`

- **Machine Learning Algorithms**  
  - Logistic Regression  
  - K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN)  
  - Decision Tree (J48)  
  - Support Vector Machine (SVC)  
  - Naive Bayes  
  - Neural Network (MLP)

- **Ensemble Methods**  
  - Bagging (Random Forest)  
  - Boosting (Gradient Boosting)

- **Evaluation Metrics**  
  - Accuracy score using `sklearn.metrics`

## 💡 Applications

- **Healthcare Decision Support**  
  Can aid doctors in preliminary screening for heart disease using basic health records.

- **Medical Research & Modeling**  
  Supports development of intelligent diagnostic systems using structured clinical data.

- **Preventive Care Systems**  
  Can be integrated into tools for continuous health monitoring and early warning alerts.
